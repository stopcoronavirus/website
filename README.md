# [www.stopcoronavirus.tech](https://www.stopcoronavirus.tech)

## Introduction

## Architecture

[www.stopcoronavirus.tech](https://www.stopcoronavirus.tech) is setup using [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) as its base layer, combined with some services that can be run by anyone to help distribute, relay and store information and data.

It has been set up to be as decentralized as possible with my available knowledge.

It still relies on DNS but it could be removed, it's probably not worth it for now.

See our repos under [gitlab.com/stopcoronavirus](https://gitlab.com/stopcoronavirus)
